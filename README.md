Task Manager

Overview

I built this Task Manager app as a refresher project to help keep track of everyday tasks in a simple and easy way. You can add new tasks, mark them as complete, and watch the progress bar update in real-time. 
The idea was to create something that looks clean, is easy to use, and feels modern. I added a few animations and made sure the app works well on different devices, just to keep things smooth and responsive.

Features
Add Tasks: Easily add tasks, and they’ll pop up in a dynamic list.

Mark Tasks as Complete: Each task has a checkbox, so when you complete it, the style updates and the progress bar moves forward.

Track Progress: There's a progress bar that shows how many tasks you’ve knocked out.

Responsive Design: The app looks good on both big and small screens, with a modern, minimalist vibe.

Animations: Subtle animations like hover effects and smooth transitions to make the experience feel a bit more polished.

Technologies I Used

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: I handled the structure with HTML, styled it with CSS, and used JavaScript to make everything interactive.

Node.js and Express: These power the back-end, managing the server and handling routes.

SQLite: For storing tasks, so you don’t lose them even if the app restarts.

Git and GitHub: For version control and collaboration during development.
